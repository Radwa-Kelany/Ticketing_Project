# PRD: Ticketing

Ticketing is a mini E-commerce web app for selling and purchasing tickets of different social events (e.g sport events, concerts, movies ... etc). It allows users to post their tickets and track its state, and other users to purchase those tickets.


## Tickets list

The site's landing page is a list of tickets, each link showing up with a title
that was given to it by the poster.

Without signing in, users are able to browse this list and navigate to the
posted tickets. After signing in, users can sell or purchase tickets and view their orders.
